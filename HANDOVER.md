# Fitness Factory KC — Coaching Platform (Handover)

A private, **login-first** coaching SaaS for a single gym. No public marketing
site — visitors land on a sign-in screen and enter one of three portals:

| Portal | Path | For |
|---|---|---|
| **Coach** | `/dashboard` | Gym owner / trainers |
| **Member** | `/client` | Gym clients |
| **Admin** | `/admin` | Gym & platform settings |

`/` redirects straight to `/login`.

---

## 1. Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000  → redirects to /login
```

Production build:

```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

Requires Node 18.18+ (Node 20+ recommended). No env vars needed to run the demo.

---

## 2. Sign in

The demo has no backend auth yet, so **any email/password works** — pick a role
(Coach / Member / Admin) on the login screen and you're in. Wiring real
authentication is the first production step (see §5).

  animated demos, nutrition plans, calendar, kanban workflow, form builder,

  fills everything with demo clients.

Data persists per browser via `localStorage` (no database yet).

## 4. Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub (see §6 to publish as a fresh standalone repo).
2. [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) → import the repo → **Deploy**
   (Next.js auto-detected, zero config). No env vars required.

---

## 5. Production roadmap

1. **Auth & roles** — NextAuth/Clerk/Supabase so Coach/Member/Admin are real
   accounts; protect `/dashboard`, `/client`, `/admin`.
2. **Database** — Postgres/Supabase; the typed shapes in `src/lib/store.tsx`
   map directly to your schema.
3. **File storage** — S3 / Supabase Storage for photos & form-check videos.
4. **Payments** — Stripe for member billing.
5. **AI** — already provider-ready; just supply keys server-side per tenant.

## 6. Publish as a new standalone GitHub repo

This project is self-contained. To carry it to its own repo with fresh history:

```bash
# from a clean copy of this project (no node_modules / .next / .git)
rm -rf node_modules .next .git
git init && git add -A
git commit -m "Fitness Factory KC coaching platform"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/<new-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

A ready-to-zip copy is provided at the repo root as
`fitness-factory-kc.tar.gz` (excludes node_modules/.next/.git) — download,
extract, then run the commands above.
